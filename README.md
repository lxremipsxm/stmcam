# Camera with STM32 and OV7670

## Getting Started

I wanted to start out by creating a simple UART script to flash to my STM32. This would give me an introduction to the compilation tools I would need, help me create a simple user-defined UART library I could then use to debug later on, and also give me an idea of how my makefiles should look for future updates. I also will avoid installing the STM32Cube IDE, since I want to work more bare-metal, and try to handle memory and registers myself.
