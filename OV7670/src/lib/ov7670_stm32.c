OV7670/ov7670_stm32.c

This file provides architecture specific data so that the ov7670 can be interfaced
with my STM32F401RE. I've named the file ov7670_stm32.c (as opposed to just stm32f401re.c, or something similar)
only to avoid file name similarities between this file and the other dependencies I need to compile 
and flash code to the board. Additionally, I want it to be clear that this is not one of the main dependencies
for having code compile correctly for the board, but rather a requirement for the ov7670 to work.
This code will likely only work with stm32f401xe boards. For now, I will work in the main project directory, 
but I will move it into inc/ later.

/*I also need to decide how to connect this thing to my STM32. 

Pins on OV7670 (Total 18)
-------------------------
Digital: {D0,...,D7}, I2C: {SCL, SDA}, Clock in: {XCLK}
Clock out: {PLK}, Power: {3.3V, DGND, PWDN}, Reset: {RET}
Sync: {VS, HS}

Need a timer/PWM pin for XCLK, 8 digital pins, Default I2C (SDA, SCL), unsure about clock out (PCLK) for now
Power is obvious; one GPIO should be dedicated to PWDN and RET each

In all, it seems I need 10 GPIOs, 8 input from OV7670 and 2 output to OV7670. 
This is how I'll connect the OV7670:

 Left side
-----------
  3.3V 3.3V
  scl 
  vsync 
  pclk PA6 - TIMER IN
  d7 PB7
  d5 PB5
  d3 PB3
  d1 PB1
  ret PB10


Right side
----------
  DGND GND
  sda 
  hsync 
  xclk PA8 TIMER OUT
  d6 
  d4 
  d2 
  d0 
  enable
